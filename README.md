# E-Commerce App

## Description
A fully functioning e-commerce application REST API using PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js (PERN). The application allows users to perform various CRUD operations such as registering an account, 
browsing products, and completing a purchase. 

## Features
- Allow users to register and log in via the API
    - Enable users to create a personal account
    - Enable users to create an account with a third-party service (Google, Facebook, etc)
- Allow CRUD operations on:
    - products
    - user accounts
    - user carts
    - orders
- Enable users to browse products
- Allow users to place an order
    - Enable users to complete a purchase using Stripe, the payment processor
- Documented API using Swagger
- Enable users to view order history
- Deploy the application using Render

## Database
The database has five tables: `customers`, `addresses`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_items`
(a join table linking orders to the products they contain).

The full design, including the Entity Relationship Diagram, column types, relationships, and the
reasoning behind each design decision, is in [docs/database-design.md](docs/database-design.md).

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22.9 or later
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (developed with v18), plus pgAdmin 4 or `psql`

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd e-commerce-app/back-end
npm install
```

### 2. Create the database
Using **pgAdmin 4**:
1. Right-click **Databases → Create → Database…**, name it `ecommerce`, and click **Save**.
2. Select the `ecommerce` database, open **Tools → Query Tool**, and check the tab title starts with `ecommerce/`.
3. Open `back-end/db/schema.sql`, then click **Execute** (or press F5).
4. Refresh the database: `customers`, `addresses`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_items` appear under **Schemas → public → Tables**.

Or using **psql** from the project root:
```bash
createdb -U postgres ecommerce
psql -U postgres -d ecommerce -f back-end/db/schema.sql
```

### 3. Configure environment variables
Create a file called `.env` in the `back-end` folder:
```
PORT=3000

PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=ecommerce
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=your-postgres-password
```
`.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so your password is never committed.

### 4. Start the server
From the `back-end` folder:
```bash
npm run dev    # restarts automatically when you save a file
npm start      # runs without auto-restart
```

### 5. Check it's working
| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Returns `Hello World!` |
| `GET /health` | Confirms the database connection. Returns `{"status":"ok","database":"ecommerce",...}`, or a `503` error if the database can't be reached |

Visit http://localhost:3000/health in your browser to test it.

## Error Handling and Testing
Implemented error handling for:
- Error 1
- Error 2
- Error 3

### Error 1


### Error 2


### Error 3


## Future Work
- Enable users to rate and review products
- Add functionality to allow for "guest" checkout (not requiring an account to place an order)
- Add admin management panel
  - Set up protected API endpoints for admin-level management access of products, customer orders, etc.
  - Create admin client UI with React to easily manage data.
- Add email notification system
  - Set up automated email service on the server to send emails to customers on completion of a purchase.
  - Set up an automated cron job to send email reminders to customers when products have been in their carts for a certain duration of time. 
- Add ability to refund customer orders
  - Set up webhook(s) that interfaces with the payment processor (Stripe) and deals with actions such as refunds.
  - When a refund is processed in Stripe, update order.
